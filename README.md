# Counter-App

A new Flutter project.

This is my first Flutter project
It's a simple counter app
I've decided to start with a counter because I'm participating in an online event called "NLW Together"
The purpose of this event is to develop an entire application from scratch using flutter and that's the very first day.

You probably already know this code because it is automatically generated when you open a new project in Flutter, but I erased everything and coded line per line to study each functionality.
